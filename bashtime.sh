# The targeted unicode characters are the "CLOCK FACE" ones
# They are located in the codepages between:
#     U+1F550 (ONE OCLOCK) and U+1F55B (TWELVE OCLOCK), for the plain hours
#     U+1F55C (ONE-THIRTY) and U+1F567 (TWELVE-THIRTY), for the thirties
#
# Those codes may be output with unicode escapes or hexadecimal escapes,
# the later being the more portable.
#
# But we can iterate only over integers.
#
# We thus need the following conversion table:
#       utf   hex   int
# hours 50:5B 90:9b 144:155
# half  5C:67 9c:a7 156:167

# The characters being grouped bas plain/thirty, we must first now
# if we are close to the 0 or 30 minutes.
# Bash using integer arithmetic by default, we do not need rounding.
# We thus add 0 (plain hour) or 12 (half).
# Then we add 144, which is the first index (as an integer).
mi=$((144+12*($min/30)))

# Add the computed minutes index (144 or 156) minus 1 (because the first hour starts at 0).
hi=$(($mi+$hour-1))

# Get the hexadecimal representation of this integer
hex=$(printf "%x" $hi)

# Print the first three bytes (that are always the same) and the computed last one.
printf "\xf0\x9f\x95\x$hex"
