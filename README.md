Bashtime
========

>A bash script to display an analog time in your command prompt on OS X

Bashtime is a short, simple script that can be used to include an
analog clock showing the current time in your command prompt,
accurate to the nearest half hour.

Use it in your PS1 environment variable to include the clock:

    export PS1="\$(~/bin/bashtime.sh)  \w "

To produce this prompt:

Use it as a script to get the clock for any time:

    ./bashtime.sh <hour (12 hours format)> <minutes>

For example:

    ./bashtime.sh 11 34
